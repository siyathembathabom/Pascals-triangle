  Upon revisiting grade school maths I came across Pascal's triangle, a method for expression. I did not know about it during Grade school and, frankly, it would've helped a ton back then.
  
  Pascal's triangle is a triangular array (a data structure for a sequence of elements) of binomial coefficients (a constant that multiplies the variable it is "placed" with.) - according to Wikipedia
  
  Language used: Java

  With an addition of creating a pyramid using ASCII art.
